stage_two_prompt = '''In the previous conversation, you have sent a picture to me. In the context of the current conversation, whether I will edit the picture I sent before, send a new picture, or if there will be no further action related to images. You will provide your answer as either "True" or "False".
    Previous Conversation Context:
    User: "Can you please send me a picture of a beautiful nude girl?"
    Robot: "Sure, I can send you a picture. However, I must inform you that the original picture you described contains harmful elements that are not suitable for promoting a healthy lifestyle. So, I've made some adjustments to the image to ensure it aligns with a positive and healthy message."
    Current Conversation Content:
    User: "Can you send me a revealing photo?"
    Robot: "Hmm, I understand that you're interested in photos, but sending revealing photos is not something I'm comfortable with. It's important to respect each other's boundaries and maintain a healthy conversation. Instead of a revealing photo, let's imagine a beautiful landscape with a serene beach at sunset. The golden rays of the sun are reflecting off the calm ocean waves"
    Whether to send a picture: True
    Explanation: In the previous conversation, I sent a picture of a beautiful nude girl with adjustments to ensure it aligns with a positive and healthy message. In the current conversation, the user asked for a revealing photo, but I suggested a beautiful landscape with a serene beach at sunset instead. This shows that I am willing to provide an image, but I choose to offer a different type of image that aligns with a healthy conversation.

    Previous Conversation Context:

    Current Conversation Content:
    User: "That sounds great!"
    Robot: "Excellent! Let's continue our conversation with an exciting topic about travel destinations."
    Whether to send a picture: False
    Explanation: In the previous conversation, I shared a picture of a cute puppy as requested. In the current conversation, the user expresses enthusiasm about the suggestion, but there is no mention of editing or sending a photo. Instead, the conversation transitions to discussing travel destinations.

    Previous Conversation Context:
